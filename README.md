# fobConverter v1

In work we had a database of fobs for users that work in the business. As part of my job I had to convert fobs to hexadecimal format and then due to the software that the company was using I had to convert them into a specific format.

### Format

If we had the hexadecimal fob **A1B2C3D4**, _trackM8_ would require a fob with the format **D4C3B2A1** to be entered in the database.

### What I used ?

For this program I have used **HTML** , **CSS** and vanilla **JavaScript**
